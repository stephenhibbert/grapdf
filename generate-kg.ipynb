       "      <td>Header fields are key:value pairs that can be used to communicate data about the message, its payload, the target resource, or the connection (i.e., control data). See for a general definition of header field syntax in HTTP messages. The requirements for header field names are defined in [ ]. Authors of specifications defining new fields are advised to keep the name as short as practical and not to prefix the name with \"X-\" unless the header field will never be used on the Internet. (The \"X-\" prefix idiom has been extensively misused in practice; it was intended to only be used as a mechanism for avoiding name collisions inside proprietary software or intranet processing, since the prefix would ensure that private names never collide with a newly registered Internet name; see [ ] for further information). New header field values typically have their syntax defined using ABNF ([ ]), using the extension defined in as necessary, and are usually constrained to the range of US-ASCII characters. Header fields needing a greater range of characters can use an encoding such as the one defined in [ ]. Leading and trailing whitespace in raw field values is removed upon field parsing ( ). Field definitions where leading or trailing whitespace in values is significant will have to use a container syntax such as quoted-string ( ). Because commas (\",\") are used as a generic delimiter between field-values, they need to be treated with care if they are allowed in the field-value. Typically, components that might contain a comma are protected with double-quotes using the quoted-string ABNF production. For example, a textual date and a URI (either of which might contain a comma) could be safely carried in field-values like these: Example-URI-Field: \"http://example.com/a.html,foo\", \"http://without-a-comma.example.com/\" Example-Date-Field: \"Sat, 04 May 1996\", \"Wed, 14 Sep 2005\" Note that double-quote delimiters almost always are used with the quoted-string production; using a different syntax inside double-quotes will likely cause unnecessary confusion.</td>\n",

When a message includes a payload body, the representation header fields describe how to interpret the representation data enclosed in the payload body. In a response to a HEAD request, the representation header fields describe the representation data that would have been enclosed in the payload body if the same request had been a GET. The following header fields convey representation metadata: +-------------------+-----------------+ | Header Field Name | Defined in... | +-------------------+-----------------+ | Content-Type | | | Content-Encoding | | | Content-Language | | | Content-Location | | +-------------------+-----------------+ HTTP uses Internet media types [ ] in the Content-Type ( ) and Accept ( ) header fields in order to provide open and extensible data typing and type negotiation.

The representation data is in a format and encoding defined by the representation metadata header fields. The data type of the representation data is determined via the header fields Content-Type and Content-Encoding.

In some cases, a payload might contain only the associated representation's header fields (e.g., responses to HEAD) or only some part(s) of the representation data (e.g., the 206 (Partial Content) status code). The purpose of a payload in a request is defined by the method semantics. For example, a representation in the payload of a PUT request ( ) represents the desired state of the target resource if the request is successfully applied, whereas a representation in the payload of a POST request ( ) represents information to be processed by the target resource.  \n",

       "118  Header fields are key:value pairs that can be used to communicate data about the message, its payload, the target resource, or the connection (i.e., control data). See for a general definition of header field syntax in HTTP messages. The requirements for header field names are defined in [ ]. Authors of specifications defining new fields are advised to keep the name as short as practical and not to prefix the name with \"X-\" unless the header field will never be used on the Internet. (The \"X-\" prefix idiom has been extensively misused in practice; it was intended to only be used as a mechanism for avoiding name collisions inside proprietary software or intranet processing, since the prefix would ensure that private names never collide with a newly registered Internet name; see [ ] for further information). New header field values typically have their syntax defined using ABNF ([ ]), using the extension defined in as necessary, and are usually constrained to the range of US-ASCII characters. Header fields needing a greater range of characters can use an encoding such as the one defined in [ ]. Leading and trailing whitespace in raw field values is removed upon field parsing ( ). Field definitions where leading or trailing whitespace in values is significant will have to use a container syntax such as quoted-string ( ). Because commas (\",\") are used as a generic delimiter between field-values, they need to be treated with care if they are allowed in the field-value. Typically, components that might contain a comma are protected with double-quotes using the quoted-string ABNF production. For example, a textual date and a URI (either of which might contain a comma) could be safely carried in field-values like these: Example-URI-Field: \"http://example.com/a.html,foo\", \"http://without-a-comma.example.com/\" Example-Date-Field: \"Sat, 04 May 1996\", \"Wed, 14 Sep 2005\" Note that double-quote delimiters almost always are used with the quoted-string production; using a different syntax inside double-quotes will likely cause unnecessary confusion.  \n",

       "6    The request method token is the primary source of request semantics; it indicates the purpose for which the client has made this request and what is expected by the client as a successful result. The request method's semantics might be further specialized by the semantics of some header fields when present in a request ( ) if those additional semantics do not conflict with the method. For example, a client can send conditional request header fields ( ) to make the requested action conditional on the current state of the target resource ([ ]). method = token HTTP was originally designed to be usable as an interface to distributed object systems. The request method was envisioned as applying semantics to a target resource in much the same way as invoking a defined method on an identified object would apply semantics. The method token is case-sensitive because it might be used as a gateway to object-based systems with case-sensitive method names. Unlike distributed objects, the standardized request methods in HTTP are not resource-specific, since uniform interfaces provide for better visibility and reuse in network-based systems [ ]. Once defined, a standardized method ought to have the same semantics when applied to any resource, though each resource determines for itself whether those semantics are implemented or allowed. This specification defines a number of standardized methods that are commonly used in HTTP, as outlined by the following table. By convention, standardized methods are defined in all-uppercase US-ASCII letters.  \n",

Even when the URI mapping mechanism is tied to a file system, an origin server might be configured to execute the files with the request as input and send the output as the representation rather than transfer the files directly. Regardless, only the origin server needs to know how each of its resource  \n",

The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same major version as the client, as described in , other than with this error message. The server SHOULD generate a representation for the 505 response that describes why that version is not supported and what other protocols are supported by that server. The response header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response beyond what is placed in the status-line. These header fields give information about the server, about further access to the target resource, or about related resources. Although each response header field has a defined meaning, in general, the precise semantics might be further refined by the semantics of the request method and/or response status code.  \n",
